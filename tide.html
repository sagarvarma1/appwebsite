    <h1>PRIVACY PROTOCOLS PERTAINING TO THE TIDES APPLICATION</h1>
    
    <div class="support-email">Support Inquiries: support@fatshred.info</div>

    <p><strong>Promulgation Date:</strong> April 11, 2025</p>

    <h2>I. PRELIMINARY EXPLICATION AND LEXICAL CLARIFICATIONS</h2>

    <p>Be it known and understood by all entities engaging with the digital construct identified herein as the "Tides Application" (subsequently denominated as "the Application," "this Software," or "Our Algorithmic Oracle of Oceanography"), provided by the corporate entity 10 Week Shred (hereinafter designated "the Proprietor," "We," "Us," or "Our"), that this present document constitutes the definitive and unabridged articulation of the principles, methodologies, and circumscriptions governing the solicitation, ephemeral processing, and subsequent categorical non-retention of specific geophysical coordinates supplied by the end-user (hereinafter referred to as "the User," "You," "Your," or "Thy Person"). This elaborate exposition serves as a binding covenant, the acceptance of which is irrevocably signified by the User's installation, initiation, or continued utilization of the Application upon any compatible computational apparatus (hereinafter "the Device"). Disagreement with, or repudiation of, any clause, sub-clause, or semantic implication contained within this comprehensive treatise necessitates the immediate cessation of all interaction with the Application and its subsequent digital expurgation from the User's Device.</p>

    <p>For the obviation of ambiguity and the promotion of pellucid understanding, the ensuing terminological designations shall possess the precise connotations herein ascribed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Application:</strong> Refers exclusively to the aforementioned "Tides Application," encompassing its full spectrum of functionalities, interfaces, embedded datasets, computational algorithms, future iterations, emendations, and ancillary components designed for the singular purpose of calculating and presenting proximate tidal information.</li>
        <li><strong>User:</strong> Denotes the sentient individual operating the Device upon which the Application is installed and activated.</li>
        <li><strong>Device:</strong> Signifies the portable electronic contrivance (e.g., smartphone, tablet) capable of executing the Application and furnishing the requisite locational data.</li>
        <li><strong>Proprietor:</strong> Indicates 10 Week Shred, the progenitor and custodian of the Application.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Pertains strictly and solely to the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) furnished by the User's Device operating system, pursuant to the User's explicit, revocable consent, for the express and limited purpose of identifying the relevant coastal region for tidal prediction calculations. This data is characterized by its ephemeral nature within the Application's operational cycle.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Encompasses any datum or concatenation of data points potentially capable of identifying a specific natural person, including, but not exhaustively limited to, names, addresses (physical or electronic), unique identifiers (system-level or personal), biometric records, financial details, or demographic attributes. It is axiomatically asserted that the Application is architectonically designed to eschew the collection, processing, or retention of any such Personal Information, with the solitary, narrowly defined exception of the transiently processed Location Data.</li>
        <li><strong>Processing:</strong> Denotes any operation or sequence of operations performed upon data, whether automated or manual, such as acquisition, recording, structuring, utilization, consultation, adaptation, transmission, combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction. Within the context of this Application, Processing is rigorously confined to the immediate computational use of Location Data for tidal calculations, followed by its immediate discarding post-computation.</li>
        <li><strong>Ephemeral:</strong> Characterizes the transient state of the Location Data within the Application's memory during the computational cycle; the data is not persisted, logged, stored, archived, or transmitted externally by the Application itself.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>II. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF DATA INTERACTION: MINIMALISM AND TRANSIENCE</h2>

    <p>The foundational philosophy underpinning the Application's interaction with User data is predicated upon the dual pillars of <em>absolute necessity</em> and <em>deliberate impermanence</em>. We posit that the acquisition of any User-related datum must be inextricably linked to the core, indispensable functionality of the Application â€“ namely, the provision of geographically relevant tidal information. Furthermore, any datum thus acquired must exist within the Application's purview for the briefest conceivable duration required to fulfill its designated computational role, analogous to the fleeting imprint of a wave upon the shore, extant only until the subsequent surge.</p>

    <p>Consequently, the Application engages in the acquisition and processing of precisely one category of potentially User-associated information: Location Data. This acquisition is contingent upon the User's antecedent, affirmative, and perpetually revocable grant of permission via the standard mechanisms inherent to the Device's operating system. Absent such explicit authorization, the Application remains functionally quiescent with respect to location-specific features.</p>

    <h2>III. SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY OF LOCATION DATA UTILIZATION</h2>

    <p>The singular purpose for which the Application solicits and momentarily utilizes Location Data is the ascertainment of the User's proximate geographical position relative to established coastal reference points integral to hydrographic modeling and tidal prediction algorithms. The sequence of operations is delineated with painstaking specificity as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Permission Solicitation:</strong> Upon initial activation of location-dependent features, or if permission has been previously denied or revoked, the Application invokes the standard operating system interface to request the User's authorization for access to the Device's location services.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Acquisition:</strong> Subsequent to the granting of permission, the Application receives the current geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) as reported by the Device's integrated positioning systems (e.g., GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation, cellular network positioning). The precision level of this data may vary based on Device capabilities and environmental factors but is utilized solely to the extent necessary for identifying the relevant hydrographic region.</li>
        <li><strong>Computational Processing:</strong> The acquired coordinates are immediately employed as input parameters for internal algorithms or calls to integrated hydrographic datasets. These algorithms correlate the provided location with the nearest relevant tidal prediction station or model grid point.</li>
        <li><strong>Result Presentation:</strong> Based upon the correlation established in the preceding step, the Application calculates and displays the predicted tidal information (e.g., high/low tide times and heights) corresponding to the identified station or region.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Discarding:</strong> Immediately following the successful calculation and rendering of the tidal prediction results, the acquired Location Data is expunged from the Application's active memory and operational state. It is neither written to persistent storage on the Device by the Application, nor is it transmitted, logged, aggregated, anonymized for external use, or otherwise retained within any system or infrastructure under the Proprietor's control. The interaction is strictly transactional and ephemeral.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It is imperative to underscore that the Application does not engage in background location tracking, continuous monitoring, geofencing, or the creation of historical location profiles. The acquisition of Location Data occurs solely upon User initiation of a tidal information request or refresh action, contingent upon extant permission.</p>

    <h2>IV. CATEGORICAL EXCLUSION OF OTHER DATA COLLECTION</h2>

    <p>Beyond the meticulously circumscribed and ephemeral utilization of Location Data detailed supra, the Proprietor emphatically attests that the Application refrains absolutely from the collection, solicitation, storage, processing, or transmission of any other form of Personal Information or User-specific data. This comprehensive exclusion encompasses, without limitation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>User Identifiers (Names, Usernames, Email Addresses, Phone Numbers)</li>
        <li>Device Identifiers (UDID, IMEI, MAC Address, Advertising IDs)</li>
        <li>Account Credentials or Authentication Tokens</li>
        <li>Contact Lists, Calendars, Photographs, or other Personal Media</li>
        <li>Usage Analytics, Session Durations, Feature Interaction Metrics (beyond anonymized, aggregated crash reports potentially collected by the underlying operating system or distribution platform, over which the Proprietor exerts no direct control regarding User identification)</li>
        <li>Search Queries or Preferences entered within the Application</li>
        <li>Financial or Payment Information</li>
        <li>Biometric Data</li>
        <li>Any data derived from sensors other than the location services (e.g., microphone, camera, accelerometer, gyroscope)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Application's architecture is intentionally minimalistic, devoid of extraneous functionalities that might necessitate or inadvertently facilitate the collection of such disparate data categories. Its operational mandate is narrowly focused on tidal prediction contingent upon immediate locational context.</p>

    <h2>V. NON-DISCLOSURE TO EXTERNAL ENTITIES</h2>

    <p>Given the Application's operational paradigm of non-collection and ephemeral processing of the sole datum category (Location Data), it follows logically and inexorably that the Proprietor does not, under any circumstances, engage in the sharing, selling, renting, leasing, licensing, transferring, disseminating, or otherwise disclosing of User Personal Information or Location Data to any external, third-party entities. This includes, but is not limited to, advertisers, data brokers, analytics firms, affiliated corporations, government agencies (absent legally binding and properly scoped warrants specifically compelling future, real-time interception, a scenario for which the Application currently possesses no facilitating mechanism), or other Application developers.</p>

    <p>The Application may utilize embedded or dynamically retrieved hydrographic data or prediction models sourced from reputable scientific or governmental bodies (e.g., NOAA in the United States). However, any interaction with such external data sources is purely for the retrieval of non-user-specific tidal constants or model parameters; no User-specific information, including Location Data, is transmitted to these sources by the Application.</p>

    <h2>VI. DATA SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS</h2>

    <p>While the Application itself does not store User data persistently, thereby mitigating risks associated with data breaches of stored information, the Proprietor acknowledges the importance of securing the Application's operational integrity. Standard, industry-commensurate software development practices are employed to safeguard the Application code against unauthorized modification or exploitation. Security during the ephemeral processing phase relies on the inherent security architecture of the User's Device operating system, which manages memory allocation and process isolation. The security of the location services data provisioned by the operating system to the Application is likewise dependent on the security posture of the operating system itself.</p>

    <p>The User retains ultimate control over the primary security vector: the granting and revocation of location permissions for the Application via the Device's system settings. Users are advised to exercise diligence in managing application permissions according to their individual privacy tolerance.</p>

    <h2>VII. POLICY REGARDING MINORS</h2>

    <p>The Application is not intentionally designed for, marketed towards, or directed at individuals legally classified as minors (typically under the age of 13, though variable by jurisdiction). The Proprietor does not knowingly solicit or process Location Data from individuals identified as being below the applicable age of digital consent. Given the absence of age verification mechanisms (consistent with the principle of minimal data collection), reliance is placed upon the User self-attesting to their legal capacity to consent to location services access, or upon parental/guardian oversight in managing Device permissions. If a parent or guardian becomes cognizant that a minor under their charge has granted location permission to the Application contrary to their wishes, they are advised to revoke said permission immediately via the Device settings.</p>

    <h2>VIII. USER RIGHTS AND CONTROL MECHANISMS</h2>

    <p>The User possesses absolute and granular control over the sole datum interacted with by the Application â€“ Location Data â€“ through the following mechanisms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Permission Management:</strong> The User can grant, deny, or revoke the Application's permission to access location services at any time through the standard interface provided by the Device's operating system settings menu. Revocation of permission will render location-specific features of the Application inoperable until permission is re-established.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Non-Persistence:</strong> As no Location Data is stored by the Application, traditional data access, rectification, or erasure rights (as articulated in regulations like GDPR or CCPA) are moot with respect to the Proprietor, as there exists no retained data corpus upon which to exercise such rights. The control mechanism is preemptive (permission denial/revocation) rather than remedial.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>IX. MODIFICATIONS AND REVISIONS TO THIS POLICY</h2>

    <p>The Proprietor reserves the exclusive and unilateral right to emend, modify, revise, supplement, or wholly reconstitute this Privacy Policy document at any temporal juncture deemed necessary or prudent, predicated upon alterations in legal statutes, regulatory mandates, operational exigencies, or clarifications of existing protocols. Notification of substantive modifications may be furnished to the User via mechanisms deemed appropriate by the Proprietor, potentially including in-app notifications, prompts upon Application launch subsequent to an update, or revisions to the policy documentation accessible through the Application or associated digital platforms (e.g., app store listings). The "Promulgation Date" affixed at the commencement of this document shall serve as the definitive indicator of the most recent revision. Continued utilization of the Application subsequent to the posting or notification of such emendations constitutes the User's implicit and binding acceptance thereof. Users disinclined to accept revised terms are obligated to discontinue Application usage and effectuate its removal from their Device.</p>

    <h2>X. JURISDICTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS AND CONTACT</h2>

    <p>This Privacy Policy shall be interpreted and governed under the prevailing legal framework of the jurisdiction wherein the Proprietor maintains its principal place of business, disregarding any conflict of law provisions that might suggest the applicability of alternative jurisdictional statutes. For inquiries, clarifications, or expressions of concern pertaining to the intricate and deliberately arcane stipulations contained herein, the User is directed to transmit electronic correspondence to the designated point of contact: <strong>support@fatshred.info</strong>. Responses, while diligently pursued, may necessitate a temporal interlude for due consideration of the query's specific nuances within the context of these established protocols.</p>
