        </div>

        <h2>2. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>Notwithstanding the fact that, as elaborated upon in subsequent sections of this Policy, we do not engage in the collection, storage, or processing of any Personal Information whatsoever, we nonetheless wish to articulate the legal framework that would hypothetically govern any such activities, were they to occur. Such elaboration is provided solely for the purpose of comprehensive legal documentation and absolute transparency.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The Application's hypothetical processing of any Personal Information would be predicated upon one or more of the following legal bases: (i) the User's explicit and informed consent; (ii) the necessity for the performance of a contract to which the User is party, or in order to take steps at the request of the User prior to entering into a contract; (iii) compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject; (iv) protection of the vital interests of the User or of another natural person; (v) performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; or (vi) the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the User which require protection of Personal Information, in particular where the User is a child.</li>
            
            <li>In jurisdictions where the concept of "legitimate interest" as a legal basis for Processing is recognized, our legitimate interests could hypothetically include: improving our Application, preventing fraud, ensuring network and information security, and direct marketing. However, as reiterated throughout this Policy, we do not collect or process any Personal Information, and thus these legitimate interests are referenced purely for theoretical completeness.</li>
            
            <li>The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), the Brazilian General Data Protection Law (LGPD), and other applicable data protection laws provide specific requirements for the legal basis of Processing. For Users residing in jurisdictions governed by such regulations, we acknowledge these requirements while emphasizing that they are not practically applicable to our non-existent data Processing activities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. COMPREHENSIVE NON-COLLECTION STATEMENT</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>We hereby unequivocally, unconditionally, and categorically affirm that we do not collect, store, process, analyze, transmit, share, sell, rent, or otherwise utilize any Personal Information or any other form of data whatsoever from Users of the Application.</strong> This comprehensive non-collection policy applies to all categories of information that could potentially be classified as Personal Information under any applicable law, regulation, or standard, including but not limited to: identifiers (such as real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, social security number, driver's license number, passport number, or other similar identifiers); personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute; characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law; commercial information; biometric information; internet or other electronic network activity information; geolocation data; audio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory, or similar information; professional or employment-related information; non-public education information; and inferences drawn from other personal information to create a profile about a consumer.</li>
            
            <li>The Application has been architecturally designed and technically engineered from its inception with a fundamental privacy-by-design approach that precludes the very possibility of data collection. The Application lacks the necessary technical infrastructure, database connections, server-side processing capabilities, or programming interfaces that would be requisite for the collection or storage of User information.</li>
            
            <li>To further elucidate the comprehensive nature of our non-collection policy, we hereby stipulate that we do not collect: (i) User registration information; (ii) usage data; (iii) device information; (iv) location data; (v) communication metadata; (vi) cookies or tracking technologies; (vii) analytics data; (viii) marketing preferences; (ix) social media information; (x) payment details; (xi) user-generated content metadata; or (xii) any other category of information that could potentially be used, either independently or in conjunction with other information, to identify or re-identify an individual User.</li>
            
            <li>The technical architecture of the Application is entirely client-side, with all computational processing occurring locally on the User's device. No information is transmitted from the User's device to our servers, as we maintain no servers, databases, or network infrastructure capable of receiving, storing, or processing such information.</li>
            
            <li>In light of this comprehensive non-collection policy, we are not deemed a "data controller" or "data processor" as defined under the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), nor a "business" or "service provider" as defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), nor any equivalent designation under any other data protection regulation, with respect to any Personal Information that might hypothetically be generated through the use of the Application.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. USER-GENERATED CONTENT AND LOCAL STORAGE</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Application may provide functionality allowing Users to generate, upload, or store content, which may include images, text, or other media formats ("User-Generated Content"). All such User-Generated Content remains exclusively on the User's device or, if the User has enabled Apple's iCloud functionality, within the User's personal iCloud account utilizing Apple's CloudKit framework.</li>
            
            <li>With respect to User-Generated Content stored via CloudKit, it is imperative to understand that such content is stored in the User's personal iCloud account pursuant to Apple Inc.'s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The contractual relationship governing such storage exists solely between the User and Apple Inc. We neither have access to, nor the technical capability to access, any User-Generated Content stored in the User's iCloud account.</li>
            
            <li>The Application utilizes Apple's CloudKit framework solely as a pass-through mechanism, facilitating the User's ability to synchronize their Application-related data across multiple devices registered to the same iCloud account. We do not, at any point in this process, intercept, view, copy, store, or otherwise process the User's data.</li>
            
            <li>Any and all computational operations, algorithmic processes, data manipulations, or other technical functionalities that involve User-Generated Content occur exclusively on the User's device, using the device's local processing capabilities, and not on any server or cloud infrastructure controlled or accessible by us.</li>
            
            <li>For absolute clarity, we hereby affirm that we have not developed, implemented, or deployed any technical means to circumvent the architectural limitations of the Application that prevent the collection of User-Generated Content or other data. Furthermore, we have not engaged any third-party entity to collect such information on our behalf.</li>
            
            <li>Any images or content you upload within the app are stored locally on your device or in your personal iCloud account using Apple's CloudKit framework.</li>
            <li>These images are never transmitted to our servers because we don't operate any servers.</li>
            <li>We cannot access, view, or process your images or any other content you create in the app.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>10 Week Shred uses Apple's CloudKit for syncing data across your devices.</li>
            <li>This means your data is stored in your personal iCloud account, subject to Apple's privacy policies.</li>
            <li>We do not incorporate any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</li>
            <li>We do not share any information with third parties because we don't collect any information to share.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Our app does not knowingly collect any data from children under the age of 13.</li>
            <li>Since we don't collect any data from anyone, this includes children as well.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>As we do not collect, store, or process any user data, there is no risk of data breaches or unauthorized access to your information on our end.</li>
            <li>The security of your device and iCloud account is managed by you and Apple, respectively.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time.</li>
