    <h1>PRIVACY PROCLAMATION FOR THE "WEEKS LEFT" APPLICATION</h1>
    
    <div class="support-email">Support Email: support@fatshred.info</div>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 11, 2025</p>

    <h2>Prologue: A Solemn Declaration</h2>

    <p>Hark! And give ear, gentle User, to this most solemn declaration of privacy practices, set forth by 10 Week Shred, makers of the "Weeks Left" application (hereinafter referred to as "the Application," "our Digital Timepiece," or "this Memento Mori"). This document doth serve as a covenant betwixt thyself and our humble company, outlining with great flourish and exacting detail how we (or rather, how we do not) collect, process, store, or otherwise manipulate thine personal information. Verily, we have crafted this Application with the utmost respect for thy privacy, such that no data of thine doth ever cross the digital threshold of our dominion.</p>

    <p>By installing and making use of this Application, thou dost acknowledge that thou hast perused this proclamation in its entirety, comprehended its verbose complexities, and consented to the terms and conditions contained herein. Should any article or verse hereof displease thee, thy sole recourse shall be to banish the Application forthwith from thy device and cease all use thereof.</p>

    <h2>Act I: Definitions and Interpretations Most Precise</h2>

    <p>For the purposes of this most elaborate privacy proclamation, these terms shall carry the meanings ascribed unto them below, lest confusion reign and clarity be vanquished:</p>

    <p><strong>"The Application"</strong> doth refer to the mobile software entitled "Weeks Left," a digital memento mori designed to calculate and display the remaining weeks in thy mortal coil, based on actuarial tables and information thou dost voluntarily provide. This encompasseth all features, functionalities, updates, and supplementary materials provided therein.</p>

    <p><strong>"Personal Information"</strong> shall encompass any particulars relating to thy person which mightst identify thee, including but not limited to thy name, electronic mail address, location, or any identifier particular to thy physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity. 'Tis of utmost importance to note that our Application is designed expressly to refrain from gathering such information.</p>

    <p><strong>"User-Provided Information"</strong> referreth solely to the birth date thou mightst enter into the Application for the calculation of thy remaining weeks, and any preferences thou mightst set for notifications. This information resideth exclusively upon thy device, much as a private journal might rest upon thy bedside table, unseen by any eyes save thine own.</p>

    <p><strong>"Device"</strong> signifieth the mobile telephone, tablet, or other portable computing apparatus upon which thou hast installed our Application.</p>

    <p><strong>"We," "Us," "Our," or "The Creator"</strong> referreth to 10 Week Shred, the entity responsible for the creation, maintenance, and distribution of the Application.</p>

    <p><strong>"Thou," "Thee," "Thy," "Thine," or "User"</strong> referreth to the individual who downloadeth, installeth, accesseth, or otherwise maketh use of the Application.</p>

    <h2>Act II: The Grand Philosophy of Non-Collection</h2>

    <p>Hear ye, hear ye! Let it be known throughout the digital realm that the cornerstone of our Application's privacy practices is the resolute commitment to the principle of non-collection. Like a ghost that leaves no footprints in the sand, our Application traverses thy device without gathering, harvesting, or absconding with thy personal data.</p>

    <h3>Scene 1: Categories of Information Not Collected</h3>

    <p>In the spirit of thorough disclosure, we shall enumerate the types of information our Application doth studiously avoid collecting:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Identifiers Personal:</strong> Thy name, electronic mail address, telephone number, physical address, or any other means by which thy person might be directly identified.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Identifiers Technical:</strong> Thy device's unique identification numbers, Internet Protocol address, advertising identifiers, or other technical markers that might distinguish thy device from others.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> The geographical coordinates of thy person or device, be they precise or approximate, derived from satellite positioning systems, wireless networks, or cellular triangulation.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Usage Information:</strong> How thou dost interact with our Application, which features thou dost utilize, how frequently thou dost open it, or how long thy sessions endure.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Content of Communications:</strong> Any messages, notes, or comments thou mightst enter into the Application, save for the birth date thou providest for calculation purposes, which remaineth solely on thy device.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Financial Information:</strong> Details of thy bank accounts, credit cards, or other payment instruments. Our Application requireth no purchase and conducteth no financial transactions.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Biometric Data:</strong> Thy fingerprints, facial features, voiceprints, or other physical characteristics that might uniquely identify thee.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Health Information:</strong> Though our Application doth contemplate mortality, it collecteth no information about thy medical conditions, physical or mental health status, or treatment history.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Scene 2: Information Thou Dost Provide</h3>

    <p>The only information our Application doth require for its proper functioning is thy date of birth, which thou may voluntarily provide. This singular piece of information is used solely for the calculation of thy remaining weeks, based on statistical life expectancy tables for thy demographic. This information resideth exclusively on thy device and is not transmitted to us or any third party.</p>

    <h3>Scene 3: Technical Architecture of Privacy</h3>

    <p>Our Application hath been designed with a technical architecture that physically preventeth the collection of thy personal information. Much like a bridge not built cannot be crossed, our Application lacks the very infrastructure necessary to transmit thy data to external servers. It operateth entirely within the confines of thy device, with all calculations, storage, and processing occurring locally.</p>

    <h2>Act III: Of Notifications and Their Nature</h2>

    <p>Our Application may, with thy express permission, send thee notifications to remind thee of thy finite existence and the swift passage of time, that thou mightst live each day with purpose and intentionality.</p>

    <h3>Scene 1: The Seeking of Permission</h3>

    <p>Before any notification may appear upon thy device, our Application shall seek thy explicit consent through the standard permission mechanism provided by thy device's operating system. Thou art under no obligation to grant this permission, and thy decision shall in no way affect the core functionality of the Application.</p>

    <h3>Scene 2: The Content of Notifications</h3>

    <p>These notifications may contain gentle reminders of thy remaining weeks, inspirational quotations on the value of time, or other memento mori contemplations. The content of these notifications is generated locally on thy device, based on templates embedded within the Application itself, and is not personalized or informed by any external data sources.</p>

    <h3>Scene 3: The Temporal Nature of Notifications</h3>

    <p>Thou mayest configure the frequency and timing of these notifications within the Application's settings. All such preferences are stored locally on thy device and are not transmitted to us or any third party.</p>

    <h2>Act IV: On Data Storage Most Local</h2>

    <h3>Scene 1: The Sanctuary of Thy Device</h3>

    <p>All information entered into or generated by our Application, including thy birth date and notification preferences, is stored exclusively within the secure storage area allocated to the Application by thy device's operating system. This area is protected by the security mechanisms of thy device, including encryption if thy device doth support it.</p>

    <h3>Scene 2: The Absence of Cloud Storage</h3>

    <p>Our Application maketh no use of cloud storage services, remote databases, or other external repositories. Thy information resideth solely on thy device, much as words written in the sand remain upon the beach until washed away by the tide.</p>

    <h3>Scene 3: Data Removal and Its Finality</h3>

    <p>Should thou choose to uninstall our Application from thy device, all associated data shall be removed according to the standard procedures of thy device's operating system. Once removed, this information cannot be recovered by us, for we never possessed it in the first place.</p>

    <h2>Act V: On the Absence of Data Sharing</h2>

    <h3>Scene 1: A Declaration of Non-Disclosure</h3>

    <p>We solemnly declare that we do not share, sell, rent, trade, or otherwise disclose any personal information to any third party, for we collect none to begin with. Like a secret never spoken, thy data remaineth undisclosed because it never crosseth the threshold of our knowledge.</p>

    <h3>Scene 2: The Non-Applicability of Common Sharing Scenarios</h3>

    <p>For the avoidance of doubt, the following common scenarios involving the sharing of user data are entirely non-applicable to our Application:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sharing with Service Providers:</strong> We engage no service providers who would require access to thy personal information for the provision of services related to our Application.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Sharing for Advertising Purposes:</strong> We participate in no advertising networks and provide no user data to advertisers, whether for targeted or non-targeted advertising.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Sharing in Corporate Transactions:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, there would be no user data to transfer as part of such transaction.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Sharing for Legal Compliance:</strong> We cannot comply with legal demands for user data that we do not possess. Should we receive such a demand, our response would necessarily be that we possess no responsive information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Act VI: Security Measures and Their Limitations</h2>

    <h3>Scene 1: The Inherent Security of Non-Collection</h3>

    <p>The most effective security measure against data breaches is the non-collection of data in the first place. As we collect no personal information through our Application, the risk of such information being compromised through our systems is, by definition, non-existent.</p>

    <h3>Scene 2: Local Security Considerations</h3>

    <p>The security of the information stored locally on thy device is contingent upon the security features of thy device and its operating system. We encourage thee to make use of thy device's security features, such as passcodes, fingerprint recognition, or facial authentication, to protect all data stored thereon, including that associated with our Application.</p>

    <h3>Scene 3: Transmission Security (Not Applicable)</h3>

    <p>As our Application transmits no personal information over networks, considerations related to the security of data in transit, such as encryption protocols or secure communication channels, are not applicable.</p>

    <h2>Act VII: On the Rights of Users in Various Realms</h2>

    <h3>Scene 1: Rights Under the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation</h3>

    <p>For Users residing within the territories of the European Economic Area, we acknowledge the rights afforded to thee under the General Data Protection Regulation, including the right of access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability, and objection to processing. However, as we collect no personal information through our Application, these rights cannot be meaningfully exercised against us, for there is no information upon which to act.</p>

    <h3>Scene 2: Rights Under the California Consumer Privacy Act</h3>

    <p>For Users residing within the State of California, we acknowledge the rights afforded to thee under the California Consumer Privacy Act, including the right to know what personal information is collected, disclosed, or sold; the right to delete personal information; the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information; and the right to non-discrimination for exercising these rights. However, as we collect no personal information through our Application, these rights cannot be meaningfully exercised against us, for there is no information upon which to act.</p>

    <h3>Scene 3: Universal Right to Local Control</h3>

    <p>Regardless of thy place of residence, thou maintainest complete control over the information stored locally on thy device through our Application. Thou mayest view, modify, or delete this information at any time through the Application's interface, or by uninstalling the Application altogether.</p>

    <h2>Act VIII: Concerning the Young and Vulnerable</h2>

    <h3>Scene 1: Age Limitations and Considerations</h3>

    <p>Our Application is not directed toward individuals below the age of 13 years (or the relevant age of digital consent in thy jurisdiction). The contemplation of mortality and the finite nature of existence may not be suitable for the very young, and parental discretion is advised.</p>

    <h3>Scene 2: Non-Collection from Children</h3>

    <p>Consistent with our general policy of non-collection, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of digital consent in thy jurisdiction). As our Application is designed not to collect personal information from any user, this policy extends naturally to children as well.</p>

    <h2>Act IX: On the Amendment of This Proclamation</h2>

    <h3>Scene 1: The Right of Revision</h3>

    <p>We reserve the right to amend, modify, or otherwise update this privacy proclamation at any time, at our sole discretion. Such amendments may be necessitated by changes in law, changes in our practices, or the addition of new features to the Application.</p>

    <h3>Scene 3: Notification of Changes</h3>

    <p>We shall endeavor to notify thee of significant changes to this proclamation through appropriate means, which may include displaying a notice within the Application or requiring thy acknowledgment upon the Application's next launch following the update.</p>

    <h3>Scene 3: Continued Use as Acceptance</h3>

    <p>Thy continued use of the Application following any amendment to this proclamation shall constitute thy acceptance of the revised terms. If thou dost not agree with the amended terms, thy sole recourse shall be to cease use of the Application and remove it from thy device.</p>

    <h2>Act X: On Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>

    <h3>Scene 1: The Law of the Land</h3>

    <p>This proclamation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which we primarily operate, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>

    <h3>Scene 2: The Resolution of Disputes</h3>

    <p>Any dispute arising from or relating to this proclamation or the Application shall first be addressed through informal negotiation. If such negotiation faileth to resolve the dispute, it shall be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of a recognized arbitration authority.</p>

    <h3>Scene 3: Limitation of Remedies</h3>

    <p>Given the non-collection of personal information by our Application, remedies related to the misuse of such information are logically limited. The most appropriate remedy for any dissatisfaction with our privacy practices would be the discontinuation of use of the Application.</p>

    <h2>Act XI: Miscellaneous Provisions and Final Words</h2>

    <h3>Scene 1: Severability of Provisions</h3>

    <p>Should any provision of this proclamation be deemed invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed from the remainder, which shall continue in full force and effect. The severed provision shall be replaced with a valid provision that most closely reflects the intent of the original.</p>

    <h3>Scene 2: The Entirety of the Agreement</h3>

    <p>This proclamation constitutes the entire agreement between thee and us regarding the privacy aspects of the Application, superseding any prior agreements, representations, or understandings, whether written or oral.</p>

    <h3>Scene 3: Waiver and Its Limitations</h3>

    <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of this proclamation shall not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision shall be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of ours.</p>

    <h3>Scene 4: Contact Information</h3>

    <p>Should thou have any questions, concerns, or inquiries regarding this proclamation or the privacy practices of our Application, thou mayest contact us at the electronic mail address provided herein: support@fatshred.info</p>

    <h2>Epilogue: A Final Reminder of Mortality</h2>

    <p>In closing, we remind thee that the purpose of our Application is to serve as a memento mori — a reminder of thy mortality. The weeks of thy life are indeed numbered, and it is our hope that this awareness shall inspire thee to live each day with purpose, intention, and appreciation for the precious gift of time. In this spirit, we have designed our Application to respect thy privacy absolutely, collecting no information about thee and allowing thee to contemplate thy finite existence in complete digital solitude.</p>

    <p>By installing and using our Application, thou dost acknowledge that thou hast read this proclamation in its entirety, understood its terms, and agreed to be bound thereby. If thou dost not agree with any part of this proclamation, we implore thee to uninstall the Application forthwith.</p>
